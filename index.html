            <h2>Top Exercises for Abs</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Plank</h3>
            <p>Hold for 30 seconds, increase time as you get stronger. This exercise helps improve your core stability and endurance.</p>

            <h3>2. Crunches</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 20 reps to target your upper abs. Keep your movements controlled to maximize the burn and avoid neck strain.</p>

            <h3>3. Leg Raises</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 15 reps to target your lower abs. Focus on controlling your legs as you raise them to really activate the core.</p>

            <h3>4. Bicycle Crunches</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 30 seconds. This exercise targets both your upper and lower abs while engaging your obliques for a full-core workout.</p>

            <h3>5. Mountain Climbers</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 30 seconds. A great exercise for building endurance and burning fat, as well as strengthening the core.</p>

            <h3>6. Russian Twists</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 20 reps on each side. This exercise works your obliques and helps improve rotational movement and flexibility.</p>

            <h3>7. Reverse Crunches</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 15 reps. Focus on pulling your hips toward your chest rather than swinging your legs up to avoid using momentum.</p>

            <h3>8. V-Situps</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 15 reps. This dynamic movement engages both your upper and lower abs, as well as your hip flexors.</p>

            <h3>9. Flutter Kicks</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 30 seconds. Flutter kicks work the lower abs and hip flexors, promoting a leaner midsection.</p>

            <h3>10. Dead Bug</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 15 reps. This is a great exercise for beginners to improve coordination and engage the entire core.</p>

            <h3>11. Toe Touches</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 20 reps. This targets the upper abs, and itâ€™s an effective exercise for improving flexibility and strength.</p>

            <h3>12. Side Plank</h3>
            <p>Hold for 30 seconds on each side. The side plank helps build your obliques and improve overall core strength.</p>

            <h3>13. Hanging Leg Raises</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 12-15 reps. This is a more advanced exercise that targets the lower abs and helps improve grip strength.</p>

            <h3>14. Ab Rollouts</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 12 reps. Using an ab roller or barbell, this exercise focuses on the entire core, including the deeper muscles.</p>

            <h3>15. Sit-ups</h3>
            <p>Perform 3 sets of 20 reps. A classic core exercise that strengthens the entire abdominal region, helping build functional core strength.</p>
